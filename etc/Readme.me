copy the tlp.conf file with sudo cp ~/tlp.conf /etc/tlp.conf

assuming the file is in your home directory 

P.S. you might wanna change the CPU_SCALING_MIN_FREQ_ON value to something lower i've set it to 2Ghz if you're cpu
can't even hit that frequency there could be problems and i'm not responsible for any damage you cause to your machine.
