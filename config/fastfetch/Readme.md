## My Edited Config of Fastfetch 

just add the line **fastfetch** to the bottom of your **.zshrc** 
or **.bashrc** file located in your home directory 

unless you're like Luke Smith who redirects all his configs
for a cleaner home directory 

## the txt and png files are ascii's to show the the image next to all the information
